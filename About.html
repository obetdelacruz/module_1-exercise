    <h2>French Loaves</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 cups warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>4-1/2 to 5 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cornmeal</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add salt, sugar and 2
        cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a
        soft dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8
        minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover
        and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half.
        Shape into 12-in.-long loaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise until
        doubled, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 450°. Sprinkle loaves with cornmeal. With a sharp knife,
        make 4 shallow slashes across the top of each loaf. Bake 15-20 minutes
        or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.
